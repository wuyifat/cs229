Logistic regression takes 5 iterations to converge. Perceptron takes 179 iterations to converge.
I prefer logistic regression because it converges faster.
If the dataset is big, in perceptron algorithm each point will be considered multiple times. It takes too much time to converge. On the other hand, logistic regression updates w as a whole and converges faster. So use logistic regression for large dataset.
